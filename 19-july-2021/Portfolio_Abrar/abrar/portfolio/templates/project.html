        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this POC OJAS-BLOGGER we have two modules like user and admin, were user have some sub modules like registration, login, adding a blog and editing a blog. Admin module has the sub modules like manage user and deleting user blog,

For this POC we have plan to go through with html for front end / user interface(UI), for storing data we have decided to go through with Database of JSON, for handling all these we have gone through python and validations are also get handle with python only. Rest API is nothing but creating a local server to run our web application

For getting values or putting values in html pages we are going through a python module called CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
